# Introduction {#intro}

The software engineering department at King Saud University gives its student the chance to spent 7-8 weeks to get industrial training.

The goal of the program is to help the students apply what they studied in an industrial field to be ready for future jobs.

I started my training program at _GeoTech_ from 04/06/2022 until 16/08/2022.

I worked with different technologies, starting with learning backend tools ..., new type of database, linux operating system and creating data pipelines.

I will talk about the the training plan, information about the training company, the work done and finally my conclusion and recommendations to improve the training program.
